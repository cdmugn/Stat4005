```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
hpi_df <- read_csv("data/hpi-tidy.csv")
```

## Exercise 1: Make a map of a variable of your choosing. In coord_map(), use projection = "mercator", which is also the default (we will see in a later exercise that this probably is not the best choice).

### Hint: in ggplot2â€™s map_data() function, there is a built in map of the "world".

### Hint: You can read more about projections in Section 17.3.2 of Modern Data Science with R

```{r}
world_map <- ggplot2::map_data("world")
world_map <- world_map %>%
   rename(Country = region)
world_hpi <- full_join(world_map, hpi_df) 
ggplot(data = world_hpi, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(colour = "black", aes(fill = LifeExpectancy)) +
  coord_map(projection = "mercator") +
  theme_void() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c()
```
